Set these environment variables (e.g., in .env.local) before running the app:

ADMIN_ID=Admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@123
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
# Optional if using webhooks for Identity or future payments
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
# App URL for redirect links if needed
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Session cookies
# Admin cookie is already used by middleware
# User cookie is used for shopper sessions after signup/login
# (Both are signed using ADMIN_SECRET)
ADMIN_SECRET=dev-secret

In production, configure these securely in your hosting provider.
